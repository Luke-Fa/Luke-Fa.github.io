# Hello World 
This is my home page! My name is Luke and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton] and my major is Electrical Engineering 
## CPSC 120
* Lab 3
    Lab 3 is my favorite because it brings together skills from earlier labs variables, functions, input/output. It introduces make and black-box testing. Giving a deeper, more professional coding and debugging experience.
* Lab 6 
    Lab 6 was my favorite becuase I always enjoyed the game blackjack. I was able to write functions for the first time that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many Aces were dealt. 
* Lab 7
    Lab 7 is my favorite because it teaches defensive programming, command line validation, and complex Boolean logic. Helping me write more reliable, robust programs. With real world domain rules.
